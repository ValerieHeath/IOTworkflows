# IOTworkflows
These  workflows are samples of automated services  that  can be built with the Avaya Breeze Engagement Designer.
The .xml will import into EngagementDesigner versions 3.4+.  Most of the samples in this repository are hosted on the Avaya Collaboratory and are available Demos as a Service.  Let me know if you would need the keys..

Workflows are "demo-grade" and delivered as-is; hardening is left as an exercise for the end user.
